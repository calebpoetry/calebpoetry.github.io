<h3><i>Words are a song</i></h3>
<h4>by Caleb Madrigal</h4>

<p>
Words are a song, and I drink them in <br />
And drunken, fall from the parapet - <br />
Into the heart and out of the mind, <br />
And swim in the shimmering ocean within. <br />
</p>

Inspiration:  Molly Bloom's Soliloquy (James Joyce), Yayo (Lana Del Rey)
